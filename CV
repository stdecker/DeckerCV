aboutme: "Ph.D. Candidate interested in understanding the integrative physiology of lifestyle-related disease (Type II Diabetes, COPD, PAD, etc.), with expertise in assessing both vascular and skeletal muscle function. Seeking Post Doctoral Research positions that expose new techniques including, but not limited to, Mass Spectometry, Immunohistochemistry, Microdialysis, and NIRS. Relevant laboratory proficiencies include collection and analysis of ^31^P-MRS data (CSIAPO & jMRUI), High-Resolution Respirometry, H~2~O~2~ Production, and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Oroboros Oxygraph O2K) in permeabilized skeletal and cardiac muscle fiber bundles, assessment of in-vivo vascular function via Doppler Ultrasound (GE & Phillips) and continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP; CNSystems), body composition analysis via DEXA (GE & Hologic), high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (XtremeCT II) exercise testing (ParvoMedics, Biodex, Quinton Q-Stress), and phlebotomy. Experience analyzing data using R, OriginPro, & GraphPad Prism."
