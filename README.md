# DeckerCV
My CV, made in R using the `vitae` package. For more information on this package, please see [this page](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae).


## Updated CV (19.04.2021)
I got a little tired of the old CV that I had and *really* wanted to add in some of the skill bars. So, I transformed (and updated) my CV using the `pagedown` [package](https://pagedown.rbind.io/) along with some very useful code from [Nick Strayer](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv), creator of `datadrivencv` and author of this [wonderful blog post](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/09/04/building_a_data_driven_cv_with_r/).
